At least 20. 
But after that is over and done with, there is another month. And then another one after that. Months are endless. 
And months turn into years and years turn into dead friends and wives and new bridges and old cars and pages upon pages upon pages of legally binding documents &#x27;&#x27;all&#x27;&#x27; of which have your signature on them. And most of those days are working days because you spent your vacation time on that one trip to Bali from which you brought along a rare disease and had to be quarantined for a month. 

Vacation time is your new currency. 

Your co-workers all know. They can tell you can tell. Your boss looks over from your cubicle to see what you&#x27;re doing. 

You&#x27;re just checking your calendar. That&#x27;s all.

You nervously dial the extension of that guy you know in sales and hang up. 
Your life returns to normal, but if you ever want to call that person again, their number is stored safely in your phone&#x27;s received calls. 

Forever, probably. You could probably just call them back at any given time, if you felt so inclined to. Just saying, it would be //pretty// easy.
